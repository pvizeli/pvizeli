I'm Pascal Vizeli, living in Switzerland. I created several years ago a system called Hass.io which had the goal that non-tech users can use and run [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) in an easy and modern way. I've created together with [Paulus Schoutsen](https://github.com/balloob) the Company [Nabu Casa, Inc.](https://github.com/NabuCasa) to support projects like [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) or [ESPHome](https://github.com/esphome) and keep it available as OpenSource for everybody.

If you enjoy what I am doing and want to support my effort, consider [subscribing to Nabu Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com) or [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/pvizeli)!
