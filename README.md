I'm Pascal Vizeli, living in Switzerland. I created severall years ago a system called Hass.io which had the goal that non-tech users can use and run [Home Assistant](https://github.com/home-assistant) in a easy and modern way. I've created together with [Paulus Schoutsen](https://github.com/balloob) the Company [Nabu Casa, Inc.](https://github.com/NabuCasa) to support project like @home-assistant or @esphome and keep it available as OpenSource for everbody.

If you enjoy what I am doing and want to support my effort, consider [subscribing to Nabu Casa](https://www.nabucasa.com) or [becoming a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/pvizeli)!
